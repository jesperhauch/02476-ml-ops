## S7 Scalable Applications
**M19 Distributed Data Loading**\
I have some experience with data loaders already from the deep learning course at DTU. It was a good refresher to do this module and get more detailed knowledge about the "brain of my computer"

**M20 Distributed Training**\
I did not complete this module as I did not have access to multiple GPUs.

**M21 Scalable Inference**\
I tried to compare the inference times for the `MobileNet` and `ResNet` but had difficulties with importing the dataloader from M19.

## S1 Getting Started
**M1 Terminal**\
I have used WSL2 for the entirety of the course and it has been a great experience so far. 
I am using a Windows machine, which has caused some issues in relation to other courses where we used Docker. 
Using WSL2 has relieved many of these pains and I will definitely be using it in the future.

**M2 Conda**\
To be fair, I've not used conda environments very much. I stick to using the Python virtual environments, since I feel more in control with these.

**M3 Editor**\
I've used VS Code for other courses and for this course as well.

**M4 PyTorch**\
My work in PyTorch is documented in the Jupyter Notebooks in this folder.

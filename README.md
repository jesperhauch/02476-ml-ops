# 02476-ml-ops Exercises
This repository contains the exercises I have coded throughout the 02476 Machine Learning Operations course.  
Below I will provide an overview of the extent I have finished the exercises in the different sessions:
- S1: Getting Started
  - M1: Not documented, but completed. Led me to use WSL2 for the entirety of the course, which has been a great tool.
  - M3: Not documented, but completed. I've used VS Code for other courses and work, so I continued using it for this course.
  - M4: Documented in `s1_getting_started`.
- S2: Organization and Version Control
  - M5 & M6: Used to create the repository and structure of the `mnist` folder.
  - M8: Completed, but is not documented in the `mnist` folder.
- S3: Reproduceability
  - M9: Documented in `mnist/trainer.dockerfile`
- S4: Debugging, Profiling and Logging
  - M11: Documented in `s4_debugging_and_logging/exercise_files/vae_mnist_bugs.py`.
  - M13: Not documented, but completed.
- S5: Continuous X
  - M15: Documented, but had some issues with Github Actions. Only got sort dependencies to work
- S6: The Cloud
  - Not documented, but completed
- S7: Scalable Applications
  - M19: Documented under `s7_scalable/distributed_data_loading`
  - M21: Documented in `s7_scalable/scalable_inference`
- S8: Deployment
  - M22: Made it some way, but struggled with getting `torchserve` to work.
